Wanted a hardware multipler for the MIPS stuff so I wrote one up. Also playing around with verilog testbenches. 
The MIPS core has been mostly behavioral and C++ verification. Need to extend it to 32 bits
but that is trivial. Need to play around with qflow or maybe vivado to figure out where to add the pipeline stages. 
Will likely becoming a 3-4 stage thing seperated in the carry a few times. 

TODO: 32 bits
TODO: Divider
TODO: Signed 32 bits

Some thoughts:
* For 32 bit MCUs do they generally have two 32 bit multiplers for signed and unsigned or a single signed 64
bit multipler. Does this even matter from a hardware prospective, need to work out the register overhead to find out. 

* Does this code synthesize as well as explicit half-adder and full-adder trees?
